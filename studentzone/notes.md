The issue you're encountering is due to a foreign key constraint (question_ibfk_1) in your database that prevents the deletion of a question set (question_set) because it is referenced by another table (question). Specifically, the set_id column in the question table has a foreign key constraint that references the id column in the question_set table. This constraint ensures data integrity by preventing deletion of a question set that still has related questions.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

Cascade Deletion (if appropriate): Modify the foreign key constraint in your database to include ON DELETE CASCADE. This option automatically deletes related rows in the question table when a corresponding row in the question_set table is deleted. Here’s how you can alter the constraint in MySQL:

sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE question 
ADD CONSTRAINT question_ibfk_1 
FOREIGN KEY (set_id) 
REFERENCES question_set (id) 
ON DELETE CASCADE;
Note: Be cautious with cascading deletes as they can lead to unintended data loss if not used carefully.

Manual Deletion of Related Rows: Before deleting a question set, manually delete related questions from the question table using a separate query. This approach allows you to control the deletion process and handle any additional logic if needed.

Here's how you can modify your deleteSet method in QuestionSetDao to delete related questions before deleting the set:

java
Copy code
public boolean deleteSet(int id) {
    // First delete related questions
    String deleteQuestionsSql = "DELETE FROM question WHERE set_id = ?";
    jdbcTemplate.update(deleteQuestionsSql, id);
    
    // Then delete the question set
    String deleteSetSql = "DELETE FROM question_set WHERE id = ?";
    return jdbcTemplate.update(deleteSetSql, id) > 0;
}
In this approach, you ensure that all related questions are deleted before attempting to delete the question set itself.

Handling Constraints in Application Logic: Alternatively, you can handle the constraint violation in your application logic by checking for related questions before attempting to delete a question set. This approach involves querying for related questions, displaying an error message or confirmation to the user, and only deleting the set if no related questions exist.

Here’s a simplified example of how you might implement this check:

java
Copy code
public boolean deleteSet(int id) {
    // Check if there are any related questions
    String countQuestionsSql = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM question WHERE set_id = ?";
    int count = jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(countQuestionsSql, Integer.class, id);
    
    if (count > 0) {
        return false; // or throw an exception indicating related questions exist
    }
    
    // Proceed to delete the question set
    String deleteSetSql = "DELETE FROM question_set WHERE id = ?";
    return jdbcTemplate.update(deleteSetSql, id) > 0;
}
Choose the approach that best fits your application's requirements and data integrity needs. The first option (cascading deletion) is the most straightforward if you are certain that deleting related questions along with the set is appropriate. The second and third options provide more control over the deletion process but require additional handling in your application logic.

The optimal approach depends on several factors and considerations specific to your application architecture, data integrity requirements, and performance considerations. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide:

Deleting via Database (Cascading Deletion)
Pros:

Data Integrity: Ensures data integrity at the database level. Deleting related rows automatically maintains referential integrity.
Performance: Deletes are handled efficiently by the database engine, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex relationships.
Simplicity: Simplifies application logic as you don’t need to manually handle deletion of related rows in your application code.
Cons:

Control: Less control over the deletion process, which might not be suitable if you need to perform additional logic or checks before deletion.
Potential Data Loss: Care must be taken with cascading deletes to avoid unintentional data loss.
Deleting via Application (Manual Deletion)
Pros:

Control: Provides greater control over the deletion process. You can implement custom logic or checks before deleting related rows.
Flexibility: Allows you to handle exceptions or edge cases specific to your application's business logic.
Auditability: Easier to audit and log deletion operations performed by the application.
Cons:

Complexity: Adds complexity to your application logic, especially when dealing with complex relationships or nested deletions.
Performance: May result in additional queries and processing overhead, especially with large datasets or frequent deletions.
Considerations for Optimal Approach
Data Integrity Requirements: If maintaining strict data integrity across your application is critical, cascading deletion at the database level is generally preferred.

Performance: Consider the performance implications, especially for operations that involve large datasets or frequent deletions. Database-level operations are often more efficient due to optimizations in the database engine.

Application Logic: Evaluate whether your application requires custom handling before or after deleting related rows. If so, performing deletions in your application code provides more flexibility.

Maintenance and Scalability: Consider long-term maintenance and scalability. Database-level constraints are often easier to manage and scale as your application grows.

Conclusion
In many cases, leveraging database constraints like cascading deletes provides a robust and efficient solution for maintaining data integrity. However, there are scenarios where manual control and application-level deletions are necessary to accommodate specific business rules or complex application logic.

Recommendation: Unless you have compelling reasons (such as complex business rules or specific audit requirements) to handle deletions manually in your application, using database-level cascading deletions is generally optimal for ensuring data integrity and performance. Always test and benchmark your approach to ensure it meets your application's requirements and performance expectations.
